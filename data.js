    container: 'Stanford University Press',
    url: 'https://www.sup.org/books/mismeasuring-impact', urlLabel: 'Publisher',
    abstract: 'The push to demonstrate effectiveness has made randomized controlled trials the presumed “gold standard” for nonprofit evaluation. Drawing on extensive interviews with nonprofit managers, evaluators, and foundation officers, this book explains why RCTs are so often the wrong tool for the sector — what happens inside organizations that adopt them, the equity problems they create, and what to do instead.'

    award: 'Honorable Mention, Robert E. Park Distinguished Scholarly Book Award (ASA)',
    abstract: 'Through ethnographic fieldwork at eight community-based organizations in Williamsburg and Bushwick, Marwell shows how the relationships these groups form with larger political and economic institutions outside the neighborhood shape the lives of the poor. The book widens the lens of urban poverty research from individuals and families to the organizations that collectively drive urban life.'
